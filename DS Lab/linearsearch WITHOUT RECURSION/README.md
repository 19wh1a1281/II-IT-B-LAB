##AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT To perform LINEAR SEARCH on a given array using WITHOUT RECURSION
 DESCRIPTION:
  we use Linear search to find whether a number is present in an array. if its present,then at what location it occurs. it is straightforward i.e we compare each element with the element to search until we find it or the list ends. it is also known as a sequential saerch. find whether a number is present in an array. if its present,then at what location it occurs. it is straightforward i.e we compare each element with the element to search until we find it or the list ends.
STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
output(key element = 15):
we check each element of the given array against the given key element = 15.
when the search reaches 6th element,the element is matched with the key element,therefore the search ends here.thus position is obtained i.e.'6'.
output1(key element = 100):
we check each element of the given array against the given key element = 100.
the search reaches the last element of the array but as no element is matched the search ends here.therefore the search is unsucessful as the element is not present.
