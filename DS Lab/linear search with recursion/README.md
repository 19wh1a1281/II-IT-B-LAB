##AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT
To perform LINEAR SEARCH on a given array using RECURSION.
DESCRIPTION:
we use Linear search to find whether a number is present in an array.
if its present,then at what location it occurs.
it is straightforward i.e we compare each element with the element to search until we find it or the list ends.
it is also known as a sequential saerch. find whether a number is present in an array. if its present,then at what location it occurs. it is straightforward i.e we compare each element with the element to search until we find it or the list ends.  
PROCEDURE:
Output 1 (key element = 15):
we check each element of the given array against the given key element = 15.
when the search reaches 6th element,the element is matched with the key element,therefore the search ends here.thus the position is obtained i.e '6'.
Output 2 (key element = 99):
we check each element of the given array against the given key element =99.
the search reaches the last element of the array but as no element is matched the saerch ends here.Therefore the search is unsucessful as the element is not present.
# OUTPUT OBTAINED
