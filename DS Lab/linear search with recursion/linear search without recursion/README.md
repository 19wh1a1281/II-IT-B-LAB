#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:
To perform LINEAR SEARCH on a given array using WITHOUT RECURSION.
DESCRIPTION:
we use linear search to find whether a number is present in an array.
if its present,then at what location it occurs.
it is also known as a sequential search.
PROCEDURE:
Output 1 (key element = 15):
we check each element of the given array against the given key element = 15.
when the search reaches 7th element,the element is matched with the key element,therefore the search ends here.thus position is obtained i.e '7'.
Output 2 (key element = 99):
we check each element of the given array against the given ke element = 99.
when the search reaches the last element of the array but as no element is matched the saerch ends here.therefore the saerch is unsucessful as the element is not present.
